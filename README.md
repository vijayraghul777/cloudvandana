Assignment Readme
This readme file provides instructions and details for the various tasks in the assignment. Please read through the following sections to understand the requirements and expectations for each task.

1. JAVA
A. Shuffle an Array
Create an array with the values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and shuffle it.

You should write your own method or function to shuffle the array without relying on built-in methods such as collections.shuffle in Java.

B. Roman Number to Integer Conversion
Take a Roman number as input (e.g., IX) and convert it to an integer (e.g., 9).

Write your own logic to implement this conversion without using built-in functions. Research and understand how Roman numerals work to complete this task.

C. Pangram Check
Check if the input is a pangram or not. A pangram is a sentence that contains all the alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.

You should create your own method or function to check for pangrams and not use built-in methods for this task.

2. JavaScript
A. Reverse Words in a Sentence
Take a sentence as input and reverse every word in that sentence. For example, if the input is "This is a sunny day," the output should be "shiT si a ynnus yad."

Ensure you create your own logic and method for reversing words in the sentence without using arrow functions or built-in JavaScript methods.

B. Sort an Array in Descending Order
Write a function to sort an array in descending order.

Avoid using built-in sorting methods, and instead, create your own sorting logic.

3. HTML
A. Basic Calculator
Create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the functionality of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

You should use the provided picture as a reference for the design and layout of the calculator. Implement the calculator's functionality using JavaScript, and make sure to include the necessary HTML and CSS for the user interface.

B. Survey Form
Create a survey form with the following fields:

First Name
Last Name
Date of Birth
Country (dropdown)
Gender (checkbox)
Profession
Email
Mobile Number
All the input fields are necessary to submit the form. Create two buttons: "Submit" and "Reset."

"Reset" should reset the form.
"Submit" should check all the fields for necessary validations and then display a popup with all the selected values along with labels.
Ensure that you implement this form's functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include necessary validation logic and ensure that the popup appears as described.
